		<h2>Part 1 Kaboom!</h2>
		<p>You wake up with a jolt of energy and see a massive hole ripped from the side of your bedroom. The whole house has been torn apart and the north wall of you room is smashed across the frozen ground outside. Your parents are nowhere to be seen. Fire truck sirens scream in the distance and you can see your neighbors from across the street peeking out from behind closed blinds with extreme curiosity. The chilly winter air begins to swirl around your ears and the blankets on your bed no longer keep you warm. It’s not clear what happened to your house. Was it a hurricane? Was it a tornado? An earthquake?</p>

        <h2></h2><br>
		<p>Maybe it was a car accident? You are so cold now. You jump out of bed in a rush to get dressed, but your whole dresser is a hundred feet away in the street and your clothes are spread out all over the icy front yard. Near the dresser you see two pairs of foot prints running off to the north and out of town. You recognize those huge boot prints and the small prints beside them. They belong to your parents. You don’t have time to think about what is going on because just at this moment the fire department arrives. You whip together a quick winter snow suit and now you must decide as the huge red fire trucks come screeching to a halt beside your torn-down house. What will you do?</p>

        <p id="decide">A. Go running to the fire fighters. They will protect you and find a place for you to stay while your parents are away.</p> <br class="dotLine">
        <p>B. Pull on your winter hat and goggles and venture north to follow where your parents went. Maybe they need your help.
